# AskMe 🚀

AskMe is a file-based Q&A platform built in **C++** that allows users to ask, answer, and manage questions in real-time. It features user authentication, threaded questions, anonymous posting, and concurrent multi-user support. The system ensures data persistence and correctness with strict permission controls.

## Features ✨

- **User Authentication** 🔒: Sign up, log in, and manage accounts securely.
- **Threaded Questions** 🔗: Ask and answer questions, with support for follow-up threads.
- **Anonymous Posting** 🙈: Users can choose to allow or disallow anonymous questions.
- **Concurrent Access** ⚡: Multiple users can use the platform simultaneously.
- **Data Persistence** 💾: Maintains users and questions across sessions using a file-based system.
